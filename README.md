- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on silicon photonics device design by using the state-of-art optimization algorithms. 

I'm experienced in:
- --> optimization methods and algorithms by using state-of-art machine learning frameworks such as Trax and Pytorch
- --> software tools commonly used in photonics design, simulation, and data analysis, such as Lumerical/FDTD, Matlab, and Python
- --> design and tape-out using commercial silicon photonics foundry PDKs (Ipkiss, Gdstk, Klayout)
- --> testing and measuring the silicon photonics fabricated devices

- familiar with the semiconductor fabrication process and passing a short tutorial in the university's cleanroom
- I am working on two main repos as my research projects named 'photonic-neural-network' and 'siphotonics'. They are private repos and just PAL members have access to them. However, they would be public in the near future.
